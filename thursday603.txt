if a class extends another class what parameters in the parent class can be seen in the child?
	All the attributes and methods from th eparent class will be seen in the child class as a 
result of inheritance. 

What is the difference between an "IS a" and "Has a" relationship, and how they are achieved?
	"Is-a" relationship is inheritance Keyword Extend or Implements. 
	"Has-a" relationship is composition Keyword Implements An instance of a class with a reference. 
to an instance of another class.
IS-A relationship is completely inheritance. This means, that the child class is a type of parent class.
HAS-A means creating instances which have references to other objects. For example, a room has a table.

NumPy Vs SciPy?
	NumPy is basically for basic operations such as sorting, indexing, and elementary functioning 
on the array data type. On the other hand, SciPy contains all the algebraic functions some of which 
are there in NumPy to some extent and not in full-fledged form.
	NumPy on data array has given rise to what is referred to as NumPy Array while SciPy does not 
have any such related array or list concepts as it is more functional and has no constraints like only 
homogeneous data or heterogeneous data applicable.
	NumPy is written in C and it is faster than SciPy is all aspects of execution.
