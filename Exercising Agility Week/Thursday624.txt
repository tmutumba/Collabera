What is an index in SQL?
	An index is an on-disk structure associated with a table or view that speeds retrieval of rows from the table or view. These keys are stored in a structure (B-tree) that enables SQL Server to find the row or rows associated with the key values quickly and efficiently.

What is the difference between "preparedstatement" and "statement" in JDBC?
	Statement – Used to execute string-based SQL queries Vs PreparedStatement – Used to execute parameterized SQL queries
	A Statement is used when SQL query is to be executed only once while Preparedstatement is used when SQL query is to be executed multiple times.
	You can not pass parameters at runtime with Statements while with PreparedStatement you can.  
	Statements are used for CREATE, ALTER, DROP statements while PreparedStatement are used for the queries which are to be executed multiple times.
	Performance is very low when using Statements as compared to preparedstatements. 

When would you use "executeUpdate" and when would you "executeQuery"
	"executeQuery" is used to execute the SQL statements which retrieve some data from the DB while "executeUpdate" is used to execute the SQL statements which update or modify the DB
	"executeQuery" returns a resultset object which contains the results returned by the query while "executeUpdate" returns an int value which represents the number of rows affected by the query.
	"executeUpdate" is used to execute only non-select queries while "executeQuery" is used to execute only select queries.
	"executeQuery" includes only select while "executeUpdate" DML and DDL.
